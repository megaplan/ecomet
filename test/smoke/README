sort of loose port of smoke-test.coffee from sockjs to erlang
modified for ecomet

tests:
- for number of clients from 1 to N:
    - one session per client
    - clients pour messages to server, receive own messages and
      messages from others
    - sessions are terminated after X time
    - result: sent, received, time, speed

parameters in app file:
- host - host and port of the server. E.g. "http://localhost:8081"
- url - part of full url after server tag, server id, session id.
  E.g. if full url is "/echo/000/1234/xhr" then url is "/xhr"
- serv_tag - service tag. E.g. "echo"
- count - how many processes to spawn
- hz - frequency for job spawning
- seconds - duration of test in seconds
- timeout - timeout for http request in milliseconds. E.g. 6000
- job_timeout - terminate job after this time. Milliseconds. E.g. 10000
- heartbeat_timeout - timeout for http request in waiting loop. SockJS
  uses 25000 milliseconds. So use little more that that.

examples:
1)
smoke_test_handler:st()

% waiting is optional
wait

smoke_test_handler:get_stat()

% if you are about to start several tests in one session then reset statistic
smoke_test_handler:reset_stat()

2)
smoke_test_handler:st([{count, 3}, {seconds, 20}, {hz, 10}])
wait
smoke_test_handler:get_stat()
